             * Dot notation:

      MDN Reference: Property accessors - dot notation
      Quote from the documentation:
      "The dot notation is typically used when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time."

      Square bracket notation:
      MDN Reference: Property accessors - square bracket notation
      Quote from the documentation:
      "The object[property] syntax is the most common way to access a property. It is mostly used if the property
      name is dynamic or is not a valid identifier."


      In the case of numeric keys or keys that are not valid identifiers, you would need to use square
      bracket notation, as indicated in the second reference. The first reference, about dot notation,
      highlights that it is typically used when you know the property name ahead of time and when the
      property name is a valid identifier.
